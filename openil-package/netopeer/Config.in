	  Netopeer is a set of NETCONF tools built on the libnetconf library.
	  It allows operators to connect to their NETCONF-enabled devices as
	  well as developers to allow control their devices via NETCONF. More
	  information about NETCONF protocol can be found at NETCONF WG.

	  With the experiences from Netopeer, we have moved our activities to
	  work on next generation of this NETCONF toolset based on libyang
	  library. Netopeer2 is mature enough to be used as a replacement of
	  the original Netopeer tools. Therefore, the Netopeer is no more
	  developed neither maintained.
