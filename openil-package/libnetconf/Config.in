	help
	  libnetconf is a NETCONF library in C intended for building NETCONF
	  clients and servers. It provides basic functions to connect NETCONF
	  client and server to each other via SSH, to send and receive NETCONF
	  messages and to store and work with the configuration data in a
	  datastore.

	  With the experiences from libnetconf, we have moved our activities
	  to work on next generation of this library based on libyang library.
	  libnetconf2 is mature enough to be used as a replacement of the
	  original libnetconf. Therefore, the libnetconf is no more developed
	  neither maintained. Note, that while libnetconf2 does not include
	  NETCONF datastore implementation, this particular functionality can
	  be implemented via sysrepo project. Similarly, the NETCONF
	  server/client implementation Netopeer is deprecated and replaced by
	  Netopeer2 which can be also used as a reference tool using
	  libnetconf2 functions.

	  libnetconf was developed by the Tools for Monitoring and
	  Configuration department of CESNET. It implements the NETCONF
	  protocol introduced by IETF - more information about NETCONF
	  protocol can be found at NETCONF WG.
