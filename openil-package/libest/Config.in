	  libest is a library that implements RFC 7030 (Enrollment over Secure Transport).
	  EST is used to provision certificates from a CA or RA. EST is a replacement for
	  SCEP, providing several security enhancements and support for ECC certificates.
	  Libest is written in C and uses OpenSSL 1.0.1. The following flows defined in RFC
	  7030 for both server and client operation have been implemented:

	  /getcacerts /csrattrs /simpleenroll /simplereenroll

	  Also of interest, a EST test server running this library has been setup at
	  http://testrfc7030.cisco.com/ and can be used for interop testing the EST protocol.
