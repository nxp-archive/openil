The Aliyun IoT SDK will get the "product key", "device name", "device secret"
parameters from json file. The benefits are:
	1. Remove the keys from source code for more secure.
	2. One process file (.c) can get more than one devices and work on them.
	3. The process file (.c) can handle different devices via update json file on board.

To use the json file for devices, please following:
	1. Create the json file as xxxx.json and put it in this directory.
	   The OpenIl will copy all the .json files in this directory to
	   /usr/sbin/ of target filesystem.
	2. Before compilation, you should put all the xxxx.json files in the
	   package/aliyun/device directory.

There is a example case in aliyun IoT SDK source code:
	aliyun-iot-sdk/sample/mqtt/mqtt-capture.c

The below is a json file sample.
NOTE: The "product_key", "dev_name", "dev_secret" charactors can NOT
be modified, the json parsing function will use them to get devices.

{
	"product_key": "xxxxxxxxx",
	"sensor-1": {
			"dev_name": "xxxxxxxx",
			"dev_secret": "xxxxxxxx"
	},
	"sensor-2": {
			"dev_name": "xxxxxxxx",
			"dev_secret": "xxxxxxxx"
	},
	"sensor-3": {
			"dev_name": "xxxxxxxx",
			"dev_secret": "xxxxxxxx"
	}
}
