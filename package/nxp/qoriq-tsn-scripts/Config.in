	  tsn-scripts is a repository for showcasing and testing IEEE 802.1 TSN
	  hardware features on NXP LS1028A-RDB and NXP LS1021A-TSN boards. The
	  repo provides an 'isochron' binary for generating isochronous traffic
	  which is latency-sensitive and helps measure propagation delay across
	  a TSN network.
