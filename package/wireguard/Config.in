	  WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN
	  that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be
	  faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while
	  avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably
	  more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a
	  general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and
	  super computers alike, fit for many different
	  circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it
	  plans to be cross-platform and widely deployable. It is
	  currently under heavy development, but already it might be
	  regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest
	  VPN solution in the industry.
