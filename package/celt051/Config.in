	  The CELT ultra-low delay audio codec

	  The CELT codec is a compression algorithm for audio. Like MP3,
	  Vorbis, and AAC it is suitable for transmitting music with
	  high quality. Unlike these formats CELT imposes very little
	  delay on the signal, even less than is typical for speech
	  centric formats like Speex, GSM, or G.729.

	  Note: this is version 0.5.1.3 of celt.
