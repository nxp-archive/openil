Subject: [PATCH] Don't add multiarch paths

The add_multiarch_paths() function leads, in certain build
environments, to the addition of host header paths to the CFLAGS,
which is not appropriate for cross-compilation. This patch fixes that
by simply removing the call to add_multiarch_paths() when we're
cross-compiling.

Investigation done by David <buildroot-2014@inbox.com>.
