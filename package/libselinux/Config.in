	  libselinux is the runtime SELinux library that provides
	  interfaces (e.g. library functions for the SELinux kernel
	  APIs like getcon(), other support functions like
	  getseuserbyname()) to SELinux-aware applications. libselinux
	  may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary policy
	  if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an
	  older version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.
