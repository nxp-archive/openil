	  QPDF is a command-line program that does structural,
	  content- preserving transformations on PDF files. It could
	  have been called something like pdf-to-pdf. It also provides
	  many useful capabilities to developers of PDF-producing
	  software or for people who just want to look at the innards
	  of a PDF file to learn more about how they work.
